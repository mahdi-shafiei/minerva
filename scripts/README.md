# Execution scripts

This directory contains the scripts used to run optimisation rounds and obtain optimiser suggestions on the experimental ML HTE campaign described in the manuscript.

```run_BO_iteration.py --current_iteration <iteration>``` was used to run Bayesian optimisation iterations 2 to 5, obtaining plates 2 to 5a.

`run_exploitative_iteration.py` contains the code used to run the exploitative iteration for plate 5b.
