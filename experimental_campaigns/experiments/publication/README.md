# HTE Experimental data 

Experimental data for the ML HTE optimisation campaign of a nickel-catalysed Suzuki reaction detailed in the manuscript. ML plate suggestions and ML training data used at each iteration are included.

Additionally, experimental data for the ML HTE optimisation of the API Pd-catalysed Buchwald-Hartwig and Ni-catalysed Suzuki reactions detailed in the manuscript is also provided. 

All collected experimental data are available in the Simple User-Friendly Reaction Format (SURF).
